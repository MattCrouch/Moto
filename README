Moto is a music creation experience using Microsoft Kinect. It is written in C# and XAML alongside the Kinect for Windows SDK.

Users can play along using the guitar or drums as air instruments, or use samples within the Wall of Sound.

Moto is a graduate project for BA Interactive Media Production at Bournemouth University.
